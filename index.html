            <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
            <p>
                Rather difficult to put in a nutshell. For my intro, I’ll start off by saying:  I am a 25-year-old male, out the box critical thinker. I am a young adult who is desperately trying to enter the world of work.  At times I am introverted but generally only, until I get to know and trust people. I eventually come out of my shell.  
            </p>
            <h2> My Story</h4>
            <p>
                My journey, my flash back to clue you in as to where I am now…
            </p>
            <p>
                I am an only child and initially I loved it that way. It was only in my early teens that I started missing a sibling. Right from the onset of my memories, my mother describes us as the magical three. Despite the fact that I grew up with a strong set of rules and values, most people out there or rather, most people within my extended family would often comment that I am spoilt rotten. I find this to be quite an annoying stigma that surrounds only children, especially me. This statement is so contradictory because being “spoilt” could not be further from the truth. From a very early age my parents taught me that nothing in life comes from a handout. On many occasions and throughout various challenges my parent’s faced, I learnt that if you wanted to achieve anything, it will come with hard work and obstacles around every bend. My parents made me earn everything I wanted or wished for, and nothing was ever handed to me on a silver platter.
            </p>
            <p>
                My father comes from a family of six siblings and my mother from a family of three. So, even though we are only three, I have loads of cousins. Some are married and their children already have children which makes my extended family even larger. As occasions arise and fall, and as annoying as cousins can be, we spend much of our time with family. Hence, whether I liked it or not, I was also taught that family is important, and family will always be family no matter what. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My parents led busy lives filled with schedules and very often, long late hours, but they always made time for me. We did lots together and I especially loved it when it was just us three. Holiday times were my favourite moments. This was sacred time to me. My mother was always calmer, and my father played games with me until I had no more energy. 
            </p>
            <p>
                So, in the beginning there were, “three…” My father and mother were married for five years and as my mother always puts it, I made my appearance, and she was blessed with “me.” 
            </p>
            <p>
                As a baby I was very ill. My parents often rushed me to hospital where I would stay for long periods. I often heard horrid stories of how they nearly lost me, until my folks met a doctor who to this day still phones my mother every year on my birthday. At the age of six and a half months, he told her that I would not survive the night and even if I do, I will not make it through the week. The story goes that my mother told him that she waited so long for me and that she believed in her very soul that I was the essence of a modern miracle and that I won’t quit. Hence from I young age I was taught never to quit, and this would be drummed into me every time a challenge came along. 
            </p>
            <p>
                After all the ups and downs and ins and outs of hospitals, my parents were advised to see some specialists in the UK, in London. And that was exactly what they did. We moved there to see if I would cope better in a colder climate. My mother was a teacher and found a job quickly. Even though my father was a qualified engineering technician, job opportunities were not so easy for him to find, so he did everything and anything that became available. We lived in London for quite some time while my health slowly improved.

            <h2> My Sport</h4>
            <p>
                Grade five was definitely my best primary school year! My best friend, whom I met in preschool, became my best competitor. That was the first year he beat me by a mere 2% in maths. This was disappointing as Maths was my favourite subject.  This was a significant year for me. I was awarded with honours in my Unisa exams for piano, won the Ameesa Maths National Maths challenge and best of all discovered table tennis. The start of my sporting career. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Table Tennis became a huge part of my life. I lived for it!! I thrived on it and everything around the sport except the politics. South Africa has much to learn about this thrilling sport. As a nation we will never really understand or love it like the Chinese. As I grew, my love for table tennis grew and so did my competitive side. Everything became about the next tournament. My journey was nourished and nurtured by my father. He was my number one supporter and biggest fan. My mother challenged me with my academics, and it was made abundantly clear by her that the one would not out way the other. Balance was tricky but if I wanted to play, I had to work hard at school.
            </p>
            <p>
                I developed from Western Province champ to claiming the South African title at the age of 14years old. Through table tennis I travelled all over the world, playing at different levels and I travelled with the South African Team and represented my country at many tournaments. Until...
            </p>
            <h2>Education</h4>
            <h4>Primary School</h6>
            <p>
                But as a child I spend most of my life surrounded by doctors, nurses physio therapist, biokineticists and treatments.  We returned to South Africa when I was five and I started my primary school career at Holy Cross Primary in Bellville. The first two years were difficult. I exceled at academics but struggled emotionally and soon realised I was a bit of an introvert; this was probably since I spent most of life with medical adults. In Grade 4 I had a major setback with my lung deficiency, and I had to adjust to new medication. We also moved, again that year. My parents made major shifts in their careers and my grandfather died.   
            </p>
            <h4>High School</h6>
            <p>
                I went to CBC St John’s High school and made some amazing friends. We were a small group of four guys.  Naturally we gravitated towards each other because we shared the same interests. As we evolved through school camps, in house Olympic Accademia competitions, music, chess and the love for anime, I’m really blessed to say, we are still friends today. High school was quite a challenge, balancing travelling with the SA team and having tutors travel with me for stretches. I did, however, have the added bonus a sometimes a “pain” of my mother being a HOD at CBC. But she was an integral part of the Senior Management Team, and this did help me navigate staying on track with my academics.  It was difficult and often exhausting. Though, because all my school holidays were filled with training camps or tournaments. But, for the love of the game, and as long as I excelled in my grades, it was all worth it!   
            </p>
            <p>
                Until the next phase of my life kicked in. My biggest challenge, it changed everything, and, in a way, I guess brought me to where I am right now.
            </p>
            <p>
            At the age of 16, just after competing in Vietnam I knew there was something seriously wrong, and there was. The most dreaded moment, the words echoed in my ears, and it was spoken into the universe. It pierced my soul and my entire life changed in one fowl swoop.  I was diagnosed with a brain tumour. YES, cancer engulfed my life and ripped me apart at a time of my life when I was just about starting to live. So, there I was right back where my memories started in and out of hospitals. Surrounded once again with doctors nurses, physios and biokineticists and treatments all over again!!!
            </p>
            <h4>University</h6>
            <p>
                But, in hindsight, I suppose the entire experience made me the adult I am today. No quitter, like my mother would always say. But again, life challenged me, and it did not make my next chapter any easier. After months at home, the support of my parents, family and my amazing four friends I survived and after 5 years of remission, only by grace I’m still going. Matric came and went and my first year of varsity was hard, two sets backs and hospital stays but I passed. Second year I plodded through. Third year, one set back. Decided to split my fourth year because therapy was difficult. The doctors termed my fate with slow growth, or no growth phase. Because I hate pity, I did not disclose much to the varsity community. I just wanted “normal” … I plodded through and tried to do the best I could with the hand I was delt… But then the horrid pandemic hit and Covid19 put a major dent in what already was a difficult journey to begin with and made it even worse. While my year group went on to graduate, I was still left plodding behind. However, here I am, finally standing on the brink of what I want, and need more than anything, and that, is to start my young adult life off. Just with a bit of hope I will graduate and start working and doing the second-best thing I love, solving, building, fixing… being part of the engineering arena any way I can. I need to be functional, contribute and give back, especially to my parents who have sacrificed so much.
